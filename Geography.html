    <div class="sectionContent">
        <p>This section is <b>NOT</b> a comprehensive view of the geography of Russia as there are millions of kilometers of land. Instead, to narrow the scope of this section, I will be providing what is necessary in order to gather the geographic context between the people and the land, because the climate zones, especially the animals within, are embedded deeply into many cultures, which reflects in their literature.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oblast (область) : administrative sub-divisions in Post-Soviet states, their word for states or provinces.</li>
            <li>Autonomous Okrug (автономный округ) : autonomous regions Russia. There are four in total, only one of which is truly autonomous while the others are under the jurisdiction of an oblast.</li>

        <p>What does the tiger, the camel, and the reindeer have in common? They all have wild populations in Russia! Each can be found in their preferred climate zone, respectively the taiga, the steppe, and the tundra, and each have significant importance to the people who cohabit in their territories, especially the reindeer. The reindeer serve an important role as a source of food and transport, being one of the few domesticated animals that can survive the harsh winters in the tundra (McMaster). Although until recently it was thought reindeer domestication started a few hundred years ago in Northern Europe, archeological evidence now suggest that they have been domesticates as far back as 2,000 years ago by the Nenets (Losey). Harnesses made from antlers and bones were found and presented to Nenets herders, who identified them as parts of early harnesses (Losey). </p>

        <p>While no authors which I will present was born here, it is historically the origin of the Nenets people, who one of the authors are. They only make 10% of the population now due to the expansion of industrialization and colonialism after the 1970s when natural-gas exploitation began (Britannica). The natural gas fields are one of the largests in the world (Britannica). The climate is tundra year-round, and it is a huge level plain without many mountains (Britannica).</p>

        <p>The climate differs more. The north still has very cold winters with mountains (although the top of the mountains may be bogs more than snow), but the south has swamps on the West Siberian Plain (Britannica). In the 1960, there was a mass migration of Russian settlers into the okrug due to the discovery of oil and natural gas deposits along the Ob River, which bisects the okrug (Britannica). This warmer and more hospitable climate led to a more solitary life (Vorobeva et al.).</p>

    <p>The Chukota Okrug is the easternmost principality in Russia, and it is only 60 miles away from Alaska (Shevchenko). Most of the peninsula is mountainous, but around the basin of the Anadyr River is relatively flat (Britannica). Like the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, it is artic, tundra year-round with reindeer herding being the main source of transport and sustenance (Britannica). The Chukchi, the Evenk, the Koryak, and the Sakha have historically settled here, but now Russian settlers all outnumber them (Britannica). The main industry export in teh okrug is gold, but there is also mining of tin, tungsten, and mercury (Britannica).</p>
