    <div class="sectionContent">
        <p>"The Way of Kinship: An Anthology of Native Siberian Literature," translated and edited by Alexander Vaschenko and Claude Clayton Smith, was published in 2010 by the University of Minnesota Press. Although I have not read this book (I admit, I should have. I just don't have the time or money now. I have $5 dollars to my name), the publisher's website includes a list of works of which they reviewed, and it's by its direction I write this. If you want more context, content, and analysis, that is where you want to begin.</p>
        <p>There is so many citations of their work due to them being a well of English translations and literary analysis in an otherwise desert named <em>Academic Disinterest</em>. However, the citations of course isn't from a book I haven't read. They're from their previous, smaller essays and translations that they published intermittently while they wrote "The Way of Kinship." I have searched for every story for other translations and literary reviews, but the language barrier is nearly impenetrable. It's so bad that Wikipedia is the only English source for many authors' bibliographies, even those most famous. I can't wait until I graduate with my Russian degree...</p>
        <p>I also can't escape the fact that there simply is very few writers.</p>

        <p>Yuri Vaella (Aivaseda) was born in 1948 in Varyogan, a village in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, and he was a member of the Nenets ethinc group (Smith). The Nenets historically lived along the Pur River, which is on the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (Smith). However, during the Civil War, they were displaced and moved south to assimilate with the Khanty, who are reindeer herders (Smith). His grandma, who was born before the move taught him the oral tradition of the Nenets (Smith). He was also educated at Moscow State Literary University, and began publishing peoms, essays, and folktales (Smith). In 1986 and 1987, he worked with an ethnographer to build <a href="https://museum-varegan.com/">The Ethnographic Park Museum of the Varyogan Village</a> ("Ethnographic Park Museum of the Varyogan Village"). He passed in 2013 ("Yuri Vella, in memoriam: Filming and Being Filmed").</p>

        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:15px">One of the largest issues for the indigenous people of the Khanty and Nenets is alcoholism and suicidality (Sumarokov et al.). There are three large factors that span the entire history of the interactions between the Russians and the natives: forced Christianization during the Russian Empire, compulsory education in boarding schools during the Soviet Union, and the modern-day environmental damage caused by oil and gas exploitation (Vorobeva et al.). The disruption to their way of life has made it impossible to sustain themselves off the land anymore and impoverished large populations of naitve people (Vorobeva et al.). This reality is what Vaella writes of in his poem "A Nomad's Progression to a Settled Life." By using repetition to represent a pattern in changing cultural attitudes over time, Vaella rhetorically documents the progression of alcoholism and how prevalent it has become.</p>
        <p>Vaella establishes a pattern of the speaker going door to door with people in his community for the first four stanzas, and with each new stanza, there is a cultural shift in what his people offer him. The first stanza is the starting point chronologically as the speaker is offered primarily meat (Vaella, lines 4,7). The second stanza approximately takes place during the initial conquering of Siberia. In 1598, Russian cossacks defeated the Khanate of Sibir, opening up west Siberia for Russian expansion (Kamenir). Peter the Great, in an effort to Christianize his enw subject and capitalize on the European fur market, implemented a fur tax that the Khanty and other peoples could only escape if they were baptized and therefore "Russified" (Vorobeva et al.). The fur needed for the tax were non-traditional game of marten and foxes, and the labor to hunt them took away their time to hunt for the traditional reindeer, which they sustained on (Vorobeva et al.). This made them depended on trading Russians for food, which included new cuisine such as bread (Vorobeva et al.). While to Western audiences, the transition from fish to bread isn't a significant leap, it was for the Khanty, because it represents a shift from a nomadic diet of reindeer into a stationary diet of Russian goods. This is what Vaella is remarking on when in the second stanza the speaker is offered bread, pie, and cow's milk (Vaella, lines 14, 17, 19). Then, stanza three is the first mention of alcohol when the speaker is offered "a mug of beer" (Vaella, 24). While Vaella does not state the causation directly, the chronological nature of the repetition creates a connect of causation of the shift in culture. Because the loss of cultural identity, Vaella represents by the shift from meat to bread, alcohol became a popular way to cope. This is further reinforced from the contrast between the ends of third and fourth stanza where "At a third door / A woman arranges / a drinking party / for my birthday" is followed by "At a third door / a woman suggests / we kill the bottle."</p>
        <p>The final stanza is a break from the repetition, and the passive speaker becomes active. He asks "Will I ever manage / to return / to the beginning of the journey?" in a plea to return back to tradition. In the context of Vaella's life, this plea is not empty. Vaella has established a museum for his people and organized protests (Smith). Therefore, he actively tries to "return to the beginning of the journey," but it is still understood that this is a fight against an unkillable leviathan of political and economic interests. This plea, although sincere and not without action, is still a plea of despair at the loss of life and culture to alcoholism and colonization. This plea breaks the pattern and ends the poem, and with how the pattern represents time, the abrupt ending could represent the speaker's own abrupt ending of his life caused by alcoholism.</p>

    <h3 id="three">III. Yeremei Aipin</h3>
    <div class="sectionContent">
        <p>Aipin was born in 1949 in the same village as Vaella, Varyogan<sup><a href="#sup2">2</a></sup> (Talivee). However, instead of being Nenets, he is Khanty, and he represented them in Soviet, Russian, and  regional parliaments (Talivee). He has many accolades which are hard to find in English, but he is well-known as a "dedicated defender" of indigenous people (Talivee). This is very much apparent in his 1990 short story, "An Epistle from God," which is set awhile after the Kazym rebellion, which was the last major conflict between the Khanty and the Soviets, occurring in 1931-1934 (Taslic). There aren't many English translations of his books despite being widely published in others, with the British Library only stocking one English translation of his works (Taslic).</p>
        <p>"An Epistle to God" is an interesting story about a White commander, Lipetsky, who escaped the Reds during the Russian Civil War and hid amongst the Khanty. The rhetorical framework of this story is told through two Khanty brothers, an elder one telling his younger about the fate of Lipetsky, and their attitude is what is most interesting about the story. Their attitude is positive and jovial, painting Lipetsky as a trickster who plays with the Reds, and this portrayal is essential a comforting poke at the Soviets. The first line in the (abridged in this English version) story is "We had more than enough of the war in our Land." (Aipin,1). War is a destructive and traumatizing force, and while the dead deserve respect, it is equally powerful to subvert expectations by using comedy to remove power from the oppressor, even if only in a literary space.</p>
        
        <p>One such poke is where Lipetsky is interrogated by the Reds, and he is able to turn the questions back on his captors and interrogate them himself. He catches the Reds on their idealism and hypocorism:</p>

        <blockquote style="line-height:25px;padding-left:5%;">
            And Lipetsky asked:<br>
            'First of all, tell me: who's going to take responsibility for the Whites that were killed?' <br>
            'The Whites went against the people, there's nothing to take responsibility for!' said the Reds. <br>
            'Who's going to take responsibility for the White Tsar, murdered unjustly and unlawfully?' asked Lipetsky. <br>
            'He was a tyrant of the people, he got what was coming to him!' the Reds replied.<br>
            'Who's going to take responsibility for the White Tsarina, murdered unjustly and unlawfully?'<br>
            'She was also a tyrant of the people, she got what was coming to her!'<br>
            'Who's going to take responsibility for the White Tsar's murdered children?!'<br>
            'Quiet!' shouted the Reds.<br>
            'Who's going to take responsibility for the White Tsar's murdered daughters?!'<br>
            'Quiet!!' the Reds roared.<br>
            'Who's going to take responsibility for the White Tsar's murdered son?!'<br>
            'Quiet!!!' the Reds howled.<br>
            'Did you summon me here to talk or to be quiet?!' asked Lipetsky.<br>
            Once the Reds had calmed down a little, they reminded him:<br>
            'Don't forget yourself, Lipetsky - you're in our hands!'<br>
            'I'll never be in your blood-stained hands,' said Lipetsky. 'My life is in the hands of my Heavenly Father. What he decides goes.'<br>
            The Reds chuckled incredulously. (Aipin, 3)
        </blockquote>

        <p>The defiance at the end is triumphant, and soon after the interrogation, Lipetsky escapes heroically, brandishing dual pistols out of his coat and rolling to dodge bullets. The NVKD, the secret police which came before the KGB (Britannica), searched for him in the Khanty's region, but they wouldn't be able to find him because the Khanty protected him. Not only that, but the <em>Khanty</em> identity protected him:</p>

        <blockquote style="text-indent:5%;">
            <p>'Why couldn't they catch him?'</p>
            <p>And having held the necessary pause, he himself replied:</p>
            <p>'He never once laid a hand on the common people, never offended them. Neither Khanty, nor Russians.'</p>
            <p>The old man was silent again, then asked:</p>
            <p>'Who were the NKVD searching for? A Russian man, a White officer, correct?'</p>
            <p>'That's correct.'</p>
            <p>'Well, almost…' my brother-in-law smiled, 'Except Lipetsky was completely like a Khanty. He wore our clothes. He rode reindeer. He was skilled with a knife and with an axe. He stood strong in our traditional hunting skis. In a word, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between him and a Khanty...' (Aipin, 13)</p>

    <h3 id="four">IV. Yuri Rytkheu</h3>
    <div class="sectionContent">
        <p>Rytkheu was born in 1930 in Uelen, which, on the the tip of the Chukotka Peninsula in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, is the easternmost settlement in Russia (Rzhevsky). There is only 60 miles of ocean between this village and Alaska (Shevchenko). Him and the villagers are Chukota (Shevchenko). He has bestsellers in Germany and Switzerland (Words Without Borders), and he won the 2006 Kiriyama Pacific Rim Prize Notable Book for the English translation of his book "A Dream in Polar Fog" (Milkweed). He</p>

            <img src="Assets\rytkheu.jpeg" width="150px" class="inline_images"><img src="Assets\uelen.jpg" width="265px" class="inline_images"><img src="Assets\uelen_map.png" width="300px" class="inline_images"><br>

        </center>
        <p>However, there is another major difference (other than being from two ends of Siberia) between him and the others: his attitude towards the Soviet Union, which evolved with his work. Rytkheu was a card-carrying member who not only "fell in line," but personally believed that the changes under the Soviet Union were positive rather than negative. He was in the first-generation of indigenous Siberians to be raised in Soviet schools, and when indigenous whale hunting had ceased and been replaced by industrial ships leaving carcases on the shore, "... in his earlier stories, Rytkheu applauded such changes" (Demuth). This is perhaps because of social programming in Soviet schools alongside lesser persecution that more western indigenous Siberians experienced, such as being executed for speaking their native tongue (Anderson).</p>
        <p>1970, with his release of "A Dream in Polar Fog," was a turning point for him. As he aged, he became more introspective on the relationship between his culture and outsiders; and began focusing on telling stories about his culture before (Demuth). It is set in the early 1910's where the only contact with white people were with Russian, Canada, and American maritime explorers (Russia didn't even patrol the border which allowed other nations to cross easily without worry). The story itself is a love letter to his own culture and their hardships, culture, and life. In a too-basic summary, it is about Canadian sailor John assimilating into their culture with passion and gratitude, experiencing life and death with people he sees as family, to the point he is considered to be indistinguishable from ethnic Chukchi. He rejects his mother who cries for him to come home - "... the John of Port Hope ten years ago does not exist any longer. There is another John now, one that's gone through trials I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy." (Rytkheu, 344). While this is set before the Soviet changes, the Revolution still occurs during the last chapters. Mr. Carpenter, an employee of the Hudson Bay Company and only other nearby white resident, travels to the village Enmyn to inform John:</p>
        <blockquote style="text-indent:5%;">
            <p>"You know that I receive the papers regularly," [Carpenter] was saying. "Obviously, you can't believe everything they write in our American newspapers. But if even half of what they write about the Bolsheviks is true, it would be better by far to live among cannibals. Their leader, Lenin - he's a monster! He's demanding the inception of  a communist government not just in Russia, but all over the world, inciting the workers to take over their factories, throw out the owners -  in a word, he's a crazed rebel! A pirate! They've proclaimed the motto: "He who doesn't work, doesn't eat!"</p>
            <p>"I've already heard that motto here, in Enmyn," John interrupted his guest. "He's not worthy of living, the man who can't feed himself. Roughly the same sentiment. (Rytkheu, 334-335)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>At first, it is hard to tell how to interpret this news. John isn't immediately alarmed, and even comments that they already have the commons in their culture; and combining with the sympathetic protagonists neutrality is the alarm of an antagonist, Mr. Carpenter. Carpenter is, to put it simply, a racist. There is a common motif in the dialogue between the two white men where Carpenter would say something racist or naive and John checks him or proves him as an idiot. For example, there is another moment where John and Carpenter observe a celebration, and John checks Carpenter:</p>

        <blockquote style="text-indent:5%;">
            <p>Carpenter drawled. "Although I do agree with you, there is an embryonic art in some of the dances. Of course, in the right hands, if this where polished up and transported to real musical interests, some of it could be good entertainment even in the States..."</p>
            <p>"They've got no business going anywhere near the States!" John cut him off abruptly. "Let everything of theirs stay here, because only they understand it and feel it as it should be understood and felt."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This motif is why one might assume immediately that John is checked Mr. Carpenter when he says "I have already heard that motto here," but it is more complex than that. Carpenter fears the Reds, because he is a capitalist - not just in idealogy, but as in class. He is an employee of the Hudson Bay Company who makes money by reselling the works of the Chukchi, which he gets by trading and debt payment (he swindles the community, a parasite). He wants to capitalize on the gold panned by explorers in a nearby river, which he understands would attract industry antagonistic to the Chukchi, as seen in America and Canada. Readers are not supposed to trust him. However, Rytkheu shows it is more complicated than that. After the conversation between John and Carpenter, John writes in his journal:</p>

        <blockquote style="text-indent:5%;">
            <em>I have the distinct feeling that Carpenter will try and get rid of me the first chance he gets. My being here has complicated matters for him, although I don't really interfere in his business. Let him trade, let him even pan for gold on the sly, as long as he doesn't pick at the hearts and souls of these people, whom he's been robbing blind with a cheerful smile on his face... But a revolution, that is more troubling. If, on one hand, the Russian csar didn't pay much attention to Chukotka, then at least the government has had more sense than to repeat the mistake of Alaska. And what can be expected of the Bolsheviks? A completely unknown quantity! Maybe they'll decide to sell Chukotka to Canada or the United States! Who knows whether the twentieth century will be the century that the Chukchi and the Aivanalin disappear forever from the face of the Earth... (Rytkheu, 229)</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>His primary fear is his peninsula being sold, because as someone raised in post-colonial state, he understands the genocide which occurred in thr name of expansion and industrialization. With this book being retrospective in nature, there is already a historical irony here. The peninsula did not need to have been sold for industrialization to disrupt the Chukchi. Reindeer was collectivized, often out of the hands of indigenous herders, and whale hunting was nationalized, often out of the hands of indigenous whalers. John holds a large contempt for white explorers from Canada and America because he knows of their crimes, but he doesn't have the clairvoyance to hold contempt for the Russians. The caution John expresses shows that there is irony being employed instead of an author's naiveté, and so, this is where Rytkheu expresses his own caution for the Reds.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h3 id="five">V. Holistic Analysis</h3>
    <div class="sectionContent">
        <p>Russian literature is known in the pop-literary world for being "depressing." There's a meme I have seen from time to time where English, French, and American writers are presented with a passionate voice of "I will die for an important concept we all agree is good," like liberty and love, and then juxtaposed to that passion, there's a painting of Dostoevsky sitting in a dark with a caption simply saying "I will die."<sup><a href="#sup3">3</a></sup> I despise this. While Russian Literature during the reign of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Gogol, etc. tended towards existentialism and realism, having read at least Dostoevsky, the "I will die" punchline in the meme, I know at least he was optimistic and held a strong love for humanity. Perhaps, instead of Dostoevsky, it would be more fitting for an author such as Vaella or Rytkheu to occupy that space. While the entire body of the indigenous Siberian literature isn't "depressing," as that would be an oversimplification (there is still joy, and joy is an act of rebellion), the themes of which they grapple with are intensely darker than anything I have read. There are few concepts heavier than the contemplation of your world dying by the hands of politics and economics until ethnographers describe you as "extinct" as if they're documenting an animal lost to natural causes. The tone consistent between every work I have read is one of fear of the future due to what they have been forced through in the past and present.</p>
        <p>Between the works of Rytkheu, Aipin, and Vaella I have presented, a chronological timeline of attitudes of the future can be constructed of before the Soviet Union, during the Soviet Union, and after the Soviet Union. Rytkheu is a portrait of the Chukchi's culture before the destruction of the Reds; Aipin's a comforting tale of a white man who deceived the Reds with the Khanty's help; Vaella is a contemplation of the contemporary issue of alcoholism replacing tradition. Rytkheu is cautious, with his culture in tact on the far end of the continent, hoping the best of the future. His protagonist, John, unknowing of the future, worried foremost about being sold to the Americans and being subject to a gold rush instead of the Soviets directly. Aipin's protagonists are actively hostile to the Soviets with the hero being a White commander as opposed to a Red or any random white guy. There is no mention of the politics of the White commander, so it is not the idealogy of the White that is at the forefront, it is his opposition to the Reds themselves. Then, finally, reaching the end of the Soviet Union, you have Vaella's poem of the result of the Empire, the Soviets, and the current Federation, and it culminates in heartache and a perpetual state of death. While Rytkheu writes of people very far removed from the Nenets and Khanty, its place in the timeline is an interesting view of an indigenous life without the struggle imposed by the Soviets, creating a contrast which makes Vaella and Aipin even more heartbreaking.</p>

            <li id="sup2">The source of the translation does not have this information, so I had to search a bit. I searched "Yeremei Aipin," and found only his Estonian Wikipedia page page. Put that through google translate to see if I can get a lead so I can look for proper sources, but the translation was bad. So I looked at the different official languages tfor the specific page, and I saw that I could translate it into Dutch, which is much closer to English. Great. It worked, and I got the location in Dutch. Time to search for the location. I typed the location into Google and searched... only for the first result to be Yuri Vaella's Dutch Wikipedia page. Amazing things are happening.</li>

                This image, while it is inaccurate most blatantly for its portrayal of Dostoevsky, is also incredibly funny for its odd choice in authors. William Shakespeare was active in the late 1500's, which is the most glaring age gap as everyone else was at least active after the 1800's. Dumas and Dostoevsky are the most comparable time-wise, so they experienced the same global literary zeitgeist. For the American author, they have Jack London, who was just born a decades or so after they died. A fine choice, but... Thoreau, author of "Civil Disobedience" and around the same age as the others, exists. Also, Shakespeare, the author of fifty million different sonnets about love, is given the caption "I will die for honor," while instead the caption "I will die for love" is given to the author most known for "The Count of Monte Cristo," a revenge fantasy about killing those who dishonored the protagonist. WHAT.
