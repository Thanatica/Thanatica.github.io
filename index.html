        <p>Russia is the world's largest country by total area, and while this is known to everyone who has ever looked at a map, it is somehow not apparent that there exists a diversity of people east of the Ural Mountains<sup>1</sup>. This is for many reasons: Russia's government, an imperialist nation which starts wars<sup>2</sup> and hijacks elections<sup>3</sup>, is in the news quite often, and most everyone in this goverment originate west of the Ural Mountains painting a false picture of ethnic representation<sup>4</sup>; Russia's colonialist history that spans three different nations<sup>5</sup> has supressed the cultures of everyone who is not ethnically Russian; and while America is known for being diverse, the minorites (indiginous and immigrants alike) are afterthoughts due to long-lasting colonialist bias in media and academia, and so it is the same with Russia.</p>
        
        <p>In a polar, poltical world inwhere America is the defualt dominate state to obey, Russia has been positioned as her main rival since the Cold War. Therefore, many people who are aware of America's crimes against humanities default to supporting Russia. However, this rebelous reaction is misguided. Russia's history is too much alike the America's in the crimes she commits, from the colonist frontier to the exported fascism. Far from rivals, their history parallels. The Russian empire conquered the Siberian steppe, reaching East, to embrace the American as she reached West, conquering the Great Plains; sowing death and reaping diaspora until they kissed on the Pacfic Rim. Their sado-masochistic tango during the Cold War, all the proxy wars in South America, Asia, and Africa, ruined the lives of millions, and even after the new century, their crimes have not stopped. Russia certainly has not stopped.<sup>5</sup></p>

        <p>The surviving indiginous populations in Siberian are to Russia either an accident or a hurdle, and while there currently isn't explicit oppression, such as in the form of illegalized languages, there is a waiting game as Russia deny support to the communities, who are struggling under the pressure of the global market. There are many responses from the communities themselves to this disregard, some hopeful and others realisitic. There is despair, horror, and even acceptance. All of this comes through in the post-colonial literature they write, which gives a rare view into a slow death of a universe.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The Ural Mountains are the mountain range which divide Europeon Russia and Asia.</li>
            <li>The Invasion of Ukraine is the largest war in Europe since WWII.</li>
            <li>See the Mueller, <em>Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election</em>.</li>
            <li>The Duma, the lower house of Russia's government, actually has a higher representation of men in an ethnic minority than women in the ethnic majority due to the policy ethnic federalism (Moser and Rybalko, 49). However, Western discussion of Russia's government is mostly centered around "Putin's Regime," which isn't invalid since it is by his command which most international affairs are made.</li>
            <li>The Tsarist Russia, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation. "The Russian Empire" as said in this project applies to all three in the same vein as "the American Empire."</li>
            <li>While I regret bringing up America in a project on Russia, because of the link between the two, it is important to let the reader know that rejection of one is not in support of the other. Something something Emma Goldman and the tyranny of the state.</li>
