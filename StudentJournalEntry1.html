    <h3><center>The INTL Compassion of Bloodywood</center></h3>
    <p>When people say that to them, the metal genre is just noise, I get disheartened. There's not anything wrong with not liking a particular genre, but to call an entire genre <i>noise</i> speaks to me as an oddly confident rejection to engage with a particularly powerful form of human love and rage. The rejection is disappointing, because of how the genre has diffused across the world to give people an active voice rather than a passive. These bands include Myrath, a power metal band from Tunisia, The Hu, a folk metal band from Mongolia, Russkaja, a "russian turbo polka metal" band from Austria, and Bloodywood, a heavy metal band from India. Bloodywood in particular is the band I will talk about, because while the other bands vary with their political intensity, Bloodywood is one-of-a-kind with how dedicated they are to using their music to bring people together, even if doing so is a political stance. The simplest way to tell you how they do this requires you to know at least a small amount of the current political situation of India: Bloodywood raps in both Hindi and Punjabi. Howver, this isn't where their commentary ends.</p>
    <p>The Hindi and Punjabi are officially translated in Bloodywood's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Bloodywood/videos" target="_blank" title="Bloodywood's Youtube Channel">music videos</a>, and each one is great to watch. I'd recommend going through their videos, because each one feels powerful in a different way. "Gaddaar" (which translates to "Traitor") is the first song on their album Rakshak, and it is specifically about the politicians in India who farm hatred for votes. Lyrics such as "I see a state turning to faith, faith turn into hate, hate turn into votes, votes turn into notes" and "Welcome to a country in disarray, where the shield of democracy lies fractured. Classism and corruption, the bows of which our leaders rise to power." are complimented by a black screen with the words "This video contains heavy politcal commentary. It is aimed at divisive leaders, parties, and poltical mindsets. In the face of fascism and communalism, we cannot remain poltically neuteral." just before the breakdown. The mention of communalism isn't a word we hear in America very foten, but it refers to violence done on ethnic or religious lines -- which is incredibly prevelant in India in the form of violent Islamaphobia. The most recent example being the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/asia/india-police-muslims.html" target="_blank" title="New York Times 'How Delhi's Police Turned Against Muslims'">2020 Delhi riots</a>, where 2/3rds of the victims were Muslim.</p>
    <p>"Dana-Dan" is not the second song on the album, but it is the second music video I watched and is similar to the rage in "Gaddaar." Instead of politicians directly, it instead targets an issue prevelant in our society. The first lyric is "I put a fist through the fist of a rapist, and yeah, I tape this for the viewing pleasure of the nameless face he disgraces." While a metal song centering sexual assult is not new, the direct reference to the "patriarchy" and how it's "no man or woman, it's the people runnin' it" does not make it seem as though this song is using the shock of rape for angry metal aesthetics (which is a common trope in much of the genre sadly). The band is intelligent and compassionate, using the power of behind their music for a real cathartic release for women who have been assualted. Many of the comments under the music video are from women who find a catharsis with this song. Another detail to point out is that while sexual assault is prevelant everywhere, in India, women are sometimes pressured into sucide so that their husband may collect the dowry. Violence against women, not just sexual, is very common in India. "Consent: get with it or get got" isn't so brave in the US, but in a country where marital rape isn't a crime, it could be. An important thing to note is that the dancers are in the costume of the Hindi God Kali, her domains of power including both change and destruction.</p>

    <p>The songs in their other music videos, "Aaj" and "Yaad," are different from the heavy sound of the two previous songs. From the video descriptions, "Aaj" is about "the moment in time when you realise you have the strength to do what you have to do to become who you want to become. We all have our demons, our reasons to be stuck in a rut of harmful patterns and our fears of trying something new. This track is meant to act as a spark to light a fire within the listener to overcome all of that;" and "Yaad" is about "the power of accepting the loss of a loved one and moving on. The lyrics celebrate the permanent impact they have on us, reiterating the belief that we carry them in our best memories, no matter how far apart we may be." These are both incredibly good songs, although not my favorites. However, I think they're important in understanding the idealogy of the band. While hard rock and metal has always had a progressive undercurrent (Rage Against the Machine, System of the Down, etc.), there is also that of fascism, which makes sense as a genre full of guys screaming it would include, even in a small category, guys screaming about the glory of war and their race. What does that small category find weak? An admission of stuggle with mental health and a heartfelt ballad about the impact of the people (and animals) in their lives. Bloodywood is full of compassion in a genre where it is very easy to lose yourself in the bloodlust and anger within the music.</p>

    <p>This brings me to their first tour: Raj Against the Machine. I have watched their documentary on their first tour, and there is always a veneer on duisplay due to the editing of the documentary itself, the moments in the documentary are very indictive of a band of just guys who brings people together despite borders. They first toured in India, then they toured in <i>Germany</i>. A beautiful moment in Germany is where their rap lyrcist (who wears the "no flag" tank top) clearly outlined their motivation. An Indian man living in Germany asked Bloodywood to help him propose to his German girlfriend, and the lyrcist, before bringing the man on stage, addressed the crowd, "There are two people in the audience that embody the spirit of this song in a very special way. He is a metalhead from India, and she is a metalhead from Germany. Their relationship transcends boundaries on many level on many levels." This exemplifies best what I love the most about this band. Their messages, while often still rooted in India, isn't bounded to India. It crosses borderes, it diffuses across the global. The compassion is for everyone.</p>
