    <h3>I. Before and During The Tsardom</h3>
    <div class="sectionContent">
        <p>Up until the 16th century, interactions between the Nenets and the Khanty were relatively peaceful, with trading mutually valuable items (Adrian-Vallance et al.; Vorobeva et al). However, the Russian, with their mercenary population of cossacks, began settling further into the east in order to set up administrative power and subsume the people as the tsar's subjects (Adrian-Vallance et al.). A fur tax, called "yasak," was pushed on the Kanty and Nenets (Vorobeva et al.). The tax was on weasel and foxes, which disrupted their usual hunting patterns of reindeer and bear, and to meet the tax, they had to spend less labor hunting meat and leather they could sustain themselves with, which made them dependent on trade with the Russians (Vorobeva et al.). During this time, the Russians were also setting up permanent settlements and capturing indigenous Nenets people to ransom them back to their families for weasel fur (Adrian-Vallance et al.).</p>
            
        <p>In the 17th century, cossack military campaigns began (Kamenir). During the Livionian war against Russia from the west, the Khanate of Sibir, Kuchum, stopped paying the fur tribute (Kamenir). This galvanized Tsar Ivan IV to recuit for a campaign west, writing “[Recruit] as many Cossack volunteers as you can call upon, all well-armed with every manner of weapon from guns to bows and arrows” (Kamenir). The cossack military took the Khanty easily, due to them being more settled, but had trouble conquering the Nenets (Adrian-Vallance et al.). The Nenets had no permanent hierarchy and could elect chiefs during battle, and due to not having a permanent location, their main focus on protecting their herds; therefore, a "loss" of running away was a strategic decision to win the day and live somewhere else (Adrian-Vallance et al.). The Khanate fell in 1598.</p>

        <p>During the 18th century, a brutal Christianization from Orthodox missionaries began (Adrian-Vallance et al.). Orthodox missionaries, sent by Peter the Great, destroyed Khanty idols and attacked sacred sites, but even despite these aggressive efforts, the Khanty's spiritual religion stayed prominent (Vorobeva et al). These aggressive efforts is exemplified by a Christian mission's attack on Vaygach, an Arctic island with 600 Nenets shrines and a place of pilgrimage for the Nenets, which destroyed the majority of shrines and forcibly converted the nearby Nenets (Adrian-Vallance et al.).</p>

        <p>After these efforts, rebellions began and ended, but until the 1917 Revolution, things relatively settled (Adrian-Vallance et al.).</p>
