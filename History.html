    <h3 id="one">I. Before and During The Tsardom</h3>
    <div class="sectionContent">
        <p>Up until the 16th century, interactions between the Nenets and the Khanty were relatively peaceful, with trading mutually valuable items (Adrian-Vallance et al.; Vorobeva et al). However, the Russian, with their mercenary population of cossacks, began settling further into the east in order to set up administrative power and subsume the people as the tsar's subjects (Adrian-Vallance et al.). A fur tax, called "yasak," was pushed on the Kanty and Nenets (Vorobeva et al.). The tax was on weasel and foxes, which disrupted their usual hunting patterns of reindeer and bear, and to meet the tax, they had to spend less labor hunting meat and leather they could sustain themselves with, which made them dependent on trade with the Russians (Vorobeva et al.). During this time, the Russians were also setting up permanent settlements and capturing indigenous Nenets people to ransom them back to their families for weasel fur (Adrian-Vallance et al.).</p>
            
        <p>In the 17th century, cossack military campaigns began (Kamenir). During the Livionian war against Russia from the west, the Khanate of Sibir, Kuchum, stopped paying the fur tribute (Kamenir). This galvanized Tsar Ivan IV to recuit for a campaign west, writing “[Recruit] as many Cossack volunteers as you can call upon, all well-armed with every manner of weapon from guns to bows and arrows” (Kamenir). The cossack military took the Khanty easily, due to them being more settled, but had trouble conquering the Nenets (Adrian-Vallance et al.). The Nenets had no permanent hierarchy and could elect chiefs during battle, and due to not having a permanent location, their main focus on protecting their herds; therefore, a "loss" of running away was a strategic decision to win the day and live somewhere else (Adrian-Vallance et al.). The Khanate fell in 1598.</p>

        <p>During the 18th century, a brutal Christianization from Orthodox missionaries began (Adrian-Vallance et al.). Orthodox missionaries, sent by Peter the Great, destroyed Khanty idols and attacked sacred sites, but even despite these aggressive efforts, the Khanty's spiritual religion stayed prominent (Vorobeva et al). These aggressive efforts is exemplified by a Christian mission's attack on Vaygach, an Arctic island with 600 Nenets shrines and a place of pilgrimage for the Nenets, which destroyed the majority of shrines and forcibly converted the nearby Nenets (Adrian-Vallance et al.).</p>

        <p>After these efforts, rebellions began and ended, but until the 1917 Revolution, things relatively settled (Adrian-Vallance et al.).</p>

    <h3 id="two">II. The Soviet Union</h3>
    <div class="sectionContent">
        <p>When the Reds came to power, there was a lot of debate on how to deal with the indigenous people. A committee called "The Committee of the North" had two rival idealogies, one where the indigenous must be left alone since they already have a communistic lifestyle and one where the indigenous must be indoctrinated, and sadly, the latter became the dominant faction (Adrian-Vallance et al.). This led to terrible state policies which drastically hurt and traumatized the indigenous people later one (Vorobeva et al.). However, before the violence took place, there were positive advancements. In 1926, the first Nenets alphabet books were produced and trading posts had schools attached to them with teachers who were educated Nenets (Adrian-Vallance et al.). Also, laws in 1922 provided by M. Speransky "set the equality in civil rights of indigenous and Russian people with preservation of their traditional ways of life." (Vorobeva et al.). The laws allowed for the Khanty and other indigenous people to practice your way of life unhindered and govern themselves, and not only that, but migrating Russians were prohibited from settling on native lands (Vorobeva et al.).</p>

        <p>This decade of peace ended in the 1930s, and a different attitude of indoctrination and resource extraction took place. The Committee of the North was replaced with the Central Administration of the Northern Sea Route, which instead of simply governing relations among the indigenous and the Russians, it sought to industrialize. Many southern Siberian peasants were forced from their land to work in construction on the Nenets' land (Adrian-Vallance et al.). After the Kazym Rebellion in 1933, where indigenous Khanty rebelled against newfound hostile change from the Soviets, anyone found to be practicing indigenous religion was executed (Vorobeva et al.). Even speaking their own language was considered illegal and punishable by death (Anderson). Any sacred site which had survived the Tsars' Christianization efforts were destroyed by the Soviets (Vorobeva et al.).</p>

        <p>Beginning int he 1930s were also forcing children to attend boarding schools, which isolated children from their families to be assimilated into Russian ways of thinking. This traumatized families, who had their children kidnapped from them, and quickly diminished the numbers of speakers in their language after only a few generations (Vorobeva et al.).</p>
        <blockquote>
            There are only 20-25 native speakers of the Eastern Khanty language and less than 10 speakers of the Southern Selkup language and all of them are the elderly. We regret to predict that by 2035-2040, their languages will have died out. The languages will disappear and so will the invaluable knowledge and experience, gained for thousands years. (Vorobeva et al.)
        </blockquote>

        <p>For the Nenets, the largest change was in their reindeer herding. The Soviets collectivized their herds, and by 1940, 80% were working on such a farm (Adrian-Vallance et al.). Even then, only a seventh of all reindeer were in collective herds with the largest herds in the North still owned by an indigenous family (Adrian-Vallance et al.). World War II changed that, because the Soviets needed more food for their soldiers, and by 1943, half of all herds were collectivized (Adrian-Vallance et al.). This caused uprisings in the Nenets which were quickly crushed with many reindeer confiscated (Adrian-Vallance et al.). After Stalin's death, the aggressive efforts to collectivized reindeer ended, and the Nenets began building their own private herds again, easily getting around the illegality (Adrian-Vallance et al.).</p>

        <p>Oil and gas workers were the final straw, and it was the migration of these Russian workers into their land that eventually outnumber the Nenets (Adrian-Vallance et al.). Oil and gas pipes were built with no respect to indigenous routes and sacred sites, so it disrupted herd migration routes and religion (Adrian-Vallance et al.). Water became polluted and poisonous to drink (Adrian-Vallance et al.). These impacted the Khanty, who settled on the Ob river, even more (Vorobeva et al).</p>

    <h3 id="three">III. The Russian Federation</h3>
    <div class="sectionContent">
        <p>Currently, the Russian Federation has less involement directly with the indigenous people. Their languages and practices were legalized, but their lands were still owned by the state, so the Russian Federation sold a lot of land to corporate gas and oil giants like Gazprom (Adrian-Vallance et al.). However, retaliation to the destruction of their land is heavily watched by the government, and indigenous protesters are arrested for false charges. In 2022, an open letter, signed by human and indigenous rights groups, was sent to Vladimir Putin (Mirovalev):</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>We, the undersigned organizations and individuals, are deeply concerned about growing intimidations and reprisals against Indigenous activists and rights defenders in Russia, exemplified by the recent illegal detention of Andrei Danilov in Murmansk region. We demand an immediate end to intimidation and harassment of Indigenous activists and Indigenous rights defenders in the Russian Federation.</p>

            <b>Detention of Sámi activist Andrei Danilov on 29 August 2021:</b>

            <p>The August detention at a festival of Sámi activist and Sámi Heritage and Development Foundation director Andrei Danilov in Monchegorsk (Murmansk region) is one of the latest incidents in a series of acts of harassment against Indigenous activists and rights defenders in Russia in recent years. Andrei Danilov was unlawfully detained by the police after, fearing for his safety, he refused to present his belongings for inspection without witnesses. The activist was detained for 5 days and charged with “failure to comply with the lawful order of a police officer”.</p>

            <b>Indigenous rights defender Stepan Petrov declared a “foreign media acting as a foreign agent” in Yakutia on 20 August, 2021:</b>

            <p>The Russian Law on Foreign Agents can now be used to target individuals. Ten days prior to Danilov’s detention, the Indigenous activist Stepan Petrov became the first Indigenous person in Russia to receive the “foreign agent” label. Petrov chairs the nonprofit group Yakutia –Our Opinion, which is well-known in Yakutia for human rights work. The activist submitted numerous appeals to the United Nations calling on the Russian government to adopt the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and to support civil society in Russia.</p>

            <b>Indigenous activist Alexander Gabyshev sentenced to compulsory treatment in a mental hospital in Yakutia on 26 July 2021:</b>

            <p>The well-known spiritual leader Alexander Gabyshev from Yakutia has been detained numerous times since his Spring 2019 march on Moscow. His detention in May 2020 resulted in his involuntary placement in a psychiatric program. The premier human rights group Memorial declared Gabyshev a political prisoner. After his release in July 2020, he was once again forced into hospitalization. In February 2021, Russia’s Investigative Committee opened a criminal case against Gabyshev under the pretense of violence against a government official, and the following month he was declared insane on the basis of a state psychiatric examination. In July 2021 a Yakutsk municipal court found him guilty of harming a police officer during an earlier arrest and sentenced him to compulsory treatment in a psychiatric clinic as a danger to others. Gabyshev will likely spend the next 2 years in a mental health institution where he does not belong.</p>

            <b>Other cases of reprisals and harassment of Indigenous activists, rights defenders, and organizations:</b>

            <p>15 September 2021: The authorities opened a criminal case against Sergei Kechimov in Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug according to media reports. The local activist who campaigns to protect the sacred lake Imlor from oil extracting giant Surgutneftegaz. According to Kechimov, he was beaten by three company employees, yet he was the one charged by the police.</p>

            <p>31 August 2021: Eiko Serotetto, a reindeer herder and Indigenous activist from the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, was sentenced to three months of personal restraint for fighting with another person in an Indigenous village. Despite the facts that Serotetto did not initiate the fight and that the brawlers subsequently reconciled, the police opened a criminal case against the activist. In 2019, Serotetto was investigated by police for organizing a meeting of Yamal reindeer herders where they discussed rights violations by oil companies.</p>

            <p>24 August 2020: Vyacheslav Krechetov, a well-known filmmaker from Kemerovo Oblast, was detained by police for organizing a public event during which the Indigenous community of Cheremza protested a new coal facility near the village. Krechetov was found guilty and fined 20,000 rubles (275 USD) for filming the event. The fine and charges were later dismissed by a local court.</p>

            <p>10 August 2020: Arsenty Nikolaev, deputy of the Yakutia Republic regional parliament and head of the Indigenous Tyanya community association, was arrested and placed under house arrest for speaking out in opposition to the activities of the Neryungri Metallik gold-mining company. After almost a year of house arrest, the regional court freed Nikolaev. However, the court did not close the criminal case against him despite the appeal court’s finding that business relations among stakeholders were legal.</p>

            <p>November 2019: a Moscow city court ordered the closure of the Center for Support of Indigenous Peoples of the North/Russian Indigenous Training Center (CSIPN/RITC) on the grounds that its legal documentation was incomplete. CSIPN was the most important independent Indigenous rights group in Russia. Human rights defenders consider the organization’s closure as the final act in a long campaign by the authorities to silence the organization. CSIPN’s leader Rodion Sulyandziga was arrested in 2016, preventing his participation in a seminar on Indigenous Peoples’ rights in Moscow. Earlier in 2014, Russian border guards stopped Sulyandziga from participating in a UN conference on Indigenous peoples’ rights by damaging his passport at the airport. Several other Indigenous activists were also stopped from traveling to the same event under questionable circumstances.</p>

            <p>This is not a complete but representative list of government reprisal cases against Indigenous activists. It shows an increasing pattern of intimidation and repression facing these activists and rights defenders. This dangerous and unlawful trend must be ceased.</p>

            <p>With this regard we, the undersigned organizations and individuals, demand an end to intimidation and harassment of Indigenous activists and Indigenous rights defenders in the Russian Federation. (Indigenous Russia)</p>

        <p>In the modern day, the actions of all Russian governments, have culminated into large portions of indigenous people being impoverished with incredibly high rates of alcoholism and drug use and even suicide (Mirovalev).</p>
